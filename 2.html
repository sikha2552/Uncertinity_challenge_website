        <p>Our dataset, comprising data from 82 patients, was gathered at the Department of
            Radiology at the University Hospital Erlangen. In compliance with the publication of CT
            images, we secured both study-specific and a broad consent from each patient. The inclusion criteria for patients stipulated the presence of as few lesions/cysts as possible. 
            However, upon further evaluation, we observed that most patients exhibited at least one cyst, with kidney cysts being prevalent. Striving for a representative portrayal of typical clinical practice, we retained a subset of patients with cysts and lesions (15).</p>
        <p>We started with 100 patient images. Of these, we removed one patient who only had thick images. Furthermore, eight patients were removed who had huge cysts or tumors, and three because of an incompletely imaged abdomen. Finally, one native image was deleted, and two after a kidney transplant. Two CT images had an error in image bit depth. One CT image could not be found. 
            These inclusion and exclusion criteria left 82 CT images. </p>

        <p>The segmentations were first done by Joy-Marie Klei√ü and then reviewed by radiologists
            with an experience of 2 and 4 years in abdominal CT imaging.
            We used the following SIEMENS CT-scanners:
            Slice thickness ranged from 0.7 and 1mm.</p>
